Our scaffolding 
by MBP
By using our package you will get a place to begin building. 
We have learned how to set up a project and this builds the basic compoents you will need for your MEAN stack.
Here we have set up your 'Public' folder contained templates for your 'index.html', 'style.css', and your 'script.js'. 
We have already loaded that script to run in your HTML. That is your front end.

Your back end will include a 'server.js' that has the basic in place of 'express' and other compoents we thought you might need to build in the future. 
As well as a MongoDB set up as well to run with your Node server. Happy building!

**required Node, if you do not have it run ' 
**'npm install --save shelljs' - 1st bash command the 1st time you run it.

After you have all of this you can run our generator.
In terminal, 'node generator.js'
